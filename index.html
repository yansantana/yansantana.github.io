                                            <h5>Family class sponsorship</h5>
                                            <p>
                                                Family class sponsorship has certain requirements, such as minimum income by the sponsor. If interested in how to sponsor someone to Canada, you should start by reviewing family sponsorship applications, eligibility, and requirements. You may be eligible to sponsor a child, spouse, or a common-law partner living outside or inside Canada, if you are 18 years of age or older, and you are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.

                                            </p>
                                            <p>When sponsoring a family member, either a dependent child or spouse/common-law partner, you are bound to support them financially in a certain period. Sponsoring a family member to Canada is a big commitment, as you must sign an undertaking agreement. Find more information on how to sponsor a relative to Canada under Family sponsorships or Spousal sponsorship, what are family sponsorship income requirements, how you should be sponsoring a child born outside of Canada, as well as surrogacy and immigration considerations.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                The spousal sponsorship program is the most in-demand stream category under family class immigration. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) strongly supports family reunification, thus spousal sponsorship application processing is given the highest priority at Canadian Visa Offices

                                            </p>
                                            <p>The spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner looking to immigrate to Canada under the spousal sponsorship category must be sponsored by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. If you applied to sponsor a spouse outside Canada, once the decision is made and the sponsorship application is approved, Canadian immigration authorities will issue the applicant a Canada Spouse Visa (a confirmation of permanent residence)</p>
                                            <p>Applicant (person being sponsored) will become a permanent resident upon landing in Canada and must enter Canada before the expiry date, which appears on a temporary visa.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Studying in Canada is an exciting and rewarding experience for many international students. Once you have decided what to study, you need to consider entry dates, application deadlines, student visa processing times, and English language requirements.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Aside from BA, MBA, Ph.D., certificate, and diploma programs, Canadian colleges and universities have a variety of short-term summer language courses, continuing education, and exchange programs. Study intake varies among Colleges or Universities but generally study intake is available during winter, spring, summer, or fall. Most foreign nationals require a study permit to study in Canada.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If your course is less than 6 months long, you will only need a visitor visa to come to Canada. However, if you plan to study for more than 6 months you will need to apply for a student study permit/visa.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To apply for a study visa, you need to obtain an acceptance letter from the educational institution. There are more than 98 universities and colleges in Canada, however, the school of your choice must be approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students. If you plan to apply to college or university, this is the first thing you should check.

                                                Every year, Canada welcomes nearly 50 million people from different countries. You can visit Canada as a tourist, to see family and friends, or to do business. Whether you plan on visiting Canada for a few days or several months, you must meet some important immigration requirements.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>During your stay, you will need enough money to support yourself and everyone included in your application.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Most travelers need to apply for a visitor visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to fly to, or transit through, a Canadian airport. Canada has a range of visas that allow you to come for a holiday or to visit friends and family, as well as some special visas that allow other activities like short-term study or business. Temporary resident visas can be good for one entry to Canada or for a period. Learn more about visitor visa options and how to extend your stay.</p>
                                            <p>You must show that you are a genuine tourist or visitor and intend to leave Canada at the end of your stay. Your family member may need a visa in order to enter Canada. If you are inviting friends or family members to visit, you need to review the list of countries and territories whose citizens need a visa. If your friend’s or family member’s country is on the list, they must apply for and be granted a visa prior to arrival to Canada.
                                            </p>

Most visitors to Canada may visit for up to 6 months on each entry. Visitors wishing to stay longer must apply for and be granted an extension.

Successful applicants will not be required to renew their visitor visa every six months, as they will be granted a multiple entry visitor visa for ten (10) years and eligible to stay in Canada for a period of up to two (2) years every visit. You can apply online or on paper to get a parent and grandparent super visa. There are also specific requirements that you must meet to be able to apply.
